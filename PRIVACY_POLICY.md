# Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** January 4, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to our Task List app. We respect your privacy. This policy describes how our application handles your data. Our app is designed to help you manage your chores and priorities locally on your device.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
We do not access or transmit your personal task list. However, we use third-party services to support the application.

* **Task Data:** The tasks, priorities, and completion status you enter are stored strictly on your device's internal memory.
* **Advertising Data:** This app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers (like Advertising ID) and usage data to serve ads.
* **No Cloud Sync:** Your task list data never leaves your phone.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use **Google AdMob** to display banner ads. Google may use unique device identifiers for advertising purposes to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion
* **Retention:** Your task list is retained on your device so that your data remains available every time you open the app.
* **Deletion:** You have full control over your data. When you select the "Clear" option within the app, that data is permanently removed from your device's local storage immediately.
* **Uninstalling:** If you uninstall the app or clear the app's data in your phone settings, all your task lists will be permanently deleted.
